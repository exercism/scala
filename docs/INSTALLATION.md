# Installing [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)

In addition to the exercism CLI and your favorite text editor, practicing with Exercism exercises in Scala requires few additional tools.

All of them could be installed automatically by the `Coursier` tool. 

See: https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ for more details.

After running `cs setup` you will be ready to get started with the Scala track of Exercism.

To get started, see "[Running the Tests](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/scala/tests)".
