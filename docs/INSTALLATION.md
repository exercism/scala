# Installing [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)


In addition to the exercism CLI and your favorite text editor, practicing with Exercism exercises in Scala requires:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later. Use your preferred vendor or grab one from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
* [Scala 2.13.x](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/scala2.html)
* [sbt 1.6.x](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

If you don't want install these various dependencies by hand, consider using [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) to manage your java and java-adjacent development tools and libraries.

After installing Java and `sbt` you will be ready to get started with the Scala track of Exercism.

To get started, see "[Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/languages/scala/tests)".
