# Tests

To run the tests, run the command `sbt test` in the exercise's directory.
See the [tests page](https://exercism.io/tracks/scala/tests) for more information.

## Skipped tests

Initially, only the first test will be enabled.
This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `pending` keyword from the beginning of the next test and work on getting that test passing.
