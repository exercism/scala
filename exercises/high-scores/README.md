# High Scores

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score, the three highest scores, and a report on the difference between the last and the highest scores.

The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.

For more detailed info about the Scala track see the [help
page](http://exercism.io/languages/scala).
