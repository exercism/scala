# Gigasecond

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond
has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

## Hints
Note that `addGigaseconds` accepts two different types of input.


The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.

Please see the [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/scala/learning) and 
[installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/scala/installation) pages if you need any help.
