# Lens Person

Use lenses to update nested records (specific to languages with immutable data).

Updating fields of nested records is kind of annoying in Haskell. One solution
is to use [lenses](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lens).  Implement several record
accessing functions using lenses, you may use any library you want. The test
suite also allows you to avoid lenses altogether so you can experiment with
different approaches.

The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.

[installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/scala/installation) pages if you need any help.
