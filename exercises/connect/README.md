# Connect

Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.

The abstract boardgame known as
[Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29) / Polygon /
CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice. Two players
place stones on a rhombus with hexagonal fields. The player to connect his/her
stones to the opposite side first wins. The four sides of the rhombus are
divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the
side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other
sides).

Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board
computes the winner (or lack thereof). Note that all games need not be "fair".
(For example, players may have mismatched piece counts.)

The boards look like this:

```text
. O . X .
 . X X O .
  O O O X .
   . X O X O
    X O O O X
```

"Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right. In
the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has
won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.

## Hints
You may notice that some test cases seem unfair. However, they may be legitimately so. For example, it is common to give young or beginner players an extra n pieces at fixed positions on the board, so mismatched piece counts can occur in an otherwise fully legal game.

In any case, this exercise cares only about determining a winner for a game that can have a variety of parameters, like board length and extra pieces. It is not interested in any other state of the game, such as who moved where, when, or whose turn it is.

So don't be puzzled by those seemingly unfair games.


The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
