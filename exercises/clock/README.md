# Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.

Please see the [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/scala/learning) and 
[installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/scala/installation) pages if you need any help.
