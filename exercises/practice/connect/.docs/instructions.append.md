# Hints
You may notice that some test cases seem unfair. However, they may be legitimately so. For example, it is common to give young or beginner players an extra n pieces at fixed positions on the board, so mismatched piece counts can occur in an otherwise fully legal game.

In any case, this exercise cares only about determining a winner for a game that can have a variety of parameters, like board length and extra pieces. It is not interested in any other state of the game, such as who moved where, when, or whose turn it is.

So don't be puzzled by those seemingly unfair games.
