# Answers Vector

```scala
object Bob {

  val ANSWERS = Vector(
    "Whatever.",
    "Sure.",
    "Whoa, chill out!",
    "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
  )

  def response(statement: String): String = {
    val input = statement.trim()
    if (input.isEmpty) return "Fine. Be that way!"
    
    val isShout =
      if (input.exists(_.isLetter) && input.toUpperCase() == input) 2 else 0
    val isQuestion = if (input.endsWith("?")) 1 else 0

    ANSWERS.apply(isQuestion + isShout)
  }
}
```

In this approach you define a [`Vector`][vector] that contains Bobâ€™s answers, and each condition is given a score.
The correct answer is selected from the array by using the score as the array index.

The `String` [`trim()`][trim] method is applied to the input to eliminate any whitespace at either end of the input.
If the string has no characters left, it returns the response for saying nothing.

~~~~exercism/caution
Note that a `null` `String` would be different from a `String` of all whitespace.
A `null` `String` would throw a `NullPointerException` if `trim()` were applied to it.
~~~~

The first half of setting `isShout` uses the [`exists`][exists] and [`isLetter`][isletter] methods to look for
at least one English alphabetic character.

This is because the second half of the condition tests that the uppercased input is the same as the input.
If the input were only `"123"` it would equal itself uppercased, but without letters it would not be a shout.

A question is determined by use of the [`endsWith()`][endswith] method to see if the input ends with a question mark.

The conditions of being a question and being a shout are assigned scores through the use of the [ternary operator][ternary].
For example, giving a question a score of `1` would use an index of `1` to get the element from the answers `Vector`, which is `"Sure."`.

| isShout | isQuestion | Index     | Answer                                |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `false` | `false`    | 0 + 0 = 0 | `"Whatever."`                         |
| `false` | `true`     | 0 + 1 = 1 | `"Sure."`                             |
| `true`  | `false`    | 2 + 0 = 2 | `"Whoa, chill out!"`                  |
| `true`  | `true`     | 2 + 1 = 3 | `"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"` |
