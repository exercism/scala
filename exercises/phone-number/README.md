# Phone Number

Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.

The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda. All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.

NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as *area code*, followed by a seven-digit local number. The first three digits of the local number represent the *exchange code*, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the *subscriber number*.

The format is usually represented as

```text
(NXX)-NXX-XXXX
```

where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.

Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code (1) if present.

For example, the inputs
- `+1 (613)-995-0253`
- `613-995-0253`
- `1 613 995 0253`
- `613.995.0253`

should all produce the output

`6139950253`

**Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.

## Hints
For simplicity and readability: Consider using the Scala collection functions instead of Java's `String` methods. Remember that in Scala a `String` is implicitly also a `Seq[Char]`, so you can call them as easily as the `String` methods.

Some examples:
- `filter` instead of `replaceAll`
- `take`, `takeRight`, `drop`, `head`, `tail` instead of `substring`

Another idea worth exploring might be to change the `String` into a `List[Char]`
and then use [pattern matching](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/how-to-use-lists-nil-cons-scala-match-case-expressions) with the `::` operator.


The Scala exercises assume an SBT project scheme. The exercise solution source
should be placed within the exercise directory/src/main/scala. The exercise
unit tests can be found within the exercise directory/src/test/scala.

To run the tests simply run the command `sbt test` in the exercise directory.
